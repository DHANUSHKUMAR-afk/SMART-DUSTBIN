Features
Dual-Chamber Design
•	Non-Biodegradable Waste Chamber: Dedicated to materials like plastics, metals, and other non-biodegradable items.
•	Biodegradable Waste Chamber: Specifically for organic waste, which undergoes processing to become compost or fertilizer.
Advanced Waste Processing
•	Fill Level Monitoring: Equipped with ultrasonic and weight sensors to track the bin's capacity in real time.
•	Automatic Transfer Mechanism: When the bin is 80% full, waste is automatically moved to the combustion chamber for processing.
•	Integrated Waste Chopping System: Features motorized blades to chop waste into smaller pieces, accelerating the decomposition and combustion process.
Sustainable Combustion System
•	Electrode-Based Combustion Chamber: Powered by renewable solar energy for eco-friendly operation.
•	Temperature Monitoring and Safety Controls: Sensors actively monitor the chamber’s temperature, pausing operations when overheating is detected to ensure safety.
•	Air Blower System: Supplies oxygen for efficient combustion and cools the system when required.
Advanced Emission Control
•	Activated Charcoal Filters: Effectively neutralize harmful gases and unpleasant odors, ensuring that only clean air is released into the environment.
Renewable Energy Integration
•	Solar Panels: Solar energy is harnessed to power the dustbin, making it a self-sustaining and environmentally friendly solution.
Real-Time Monitoring and Connectivity
•	Web Application Integration: Provides real-time updates on fill levels, temperature, and system status to municipal authorities, streamlining waste collection and management processes.
