# Smart Composting Dustbin

## Overview
The **Smart Composting Dustbin** is an innovative and intelligent system designed for efficient and eco-friendly waste management. It transforms organic waste into mineral-rich ash, which can then be processed into high-quality fertilizer. By integrating cutting-edge technology, this system promotes sustainable waste disposal practices, reduces environmental impact, and contributes to the circular economy.

## Features

### Dual-Chamber Design
- **Non-Biodegradable Waste Chamber**: For materials like plastics, metals, and other non-biodegradable items.
- **Biodegradable Waste Chamber**: Specifically for organic waste, which undergoes processing to become compost or fertilizer.

### Advanced Waste Processing
- **Fill Level Monitoring**: Ultrasonic and weight sensors track the bin's capacity in real-time.
- **Automatic Transfer Mechanism**: Transfers waste to the combustion chamber when the bin reaches 80% capacity.
- **Integrated Waste Chopping System**: Motorized blades chop waste into smaller pieces for faster processing.

### Sustainable Combustion System
- **Electrode-Based Combustion Chamber**: Uses solar energy for eco-friendly operations.
- **Temperature Monitoring and Safety Controls**: Sensors ensure safe operation by pausing the system when overheating is detected.
- **Air Blower System**: Supplies oxygen for combustion and cools the system as needed.

### Advanced Emission Control
- **Activated Charcoal Filters**: Neutralize harmful gases and unpleasant odors, ensuring only clean air is released.

### Renewable Energy Integration
- **Solar Panels**: Powers the dustbin sustainably using renewable solar energy.

### Real-Time Monitoring and Connectivity
- **Web Application Integration**: Sends real-time updates on fill levels, temperature, and system status to municipal authorities.
